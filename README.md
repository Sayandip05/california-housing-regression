# California Housing Price Prediction

This is my **first Machine Learning project** where I applied **Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict housing prices using the **California Housing dataset** (from `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing`).

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in regression analysis:
- Understand how **Linear Regression** works (with one feature).
- Explore **Multiple Linear Regression** (with multiple features).
- Learn how to preprocess data, train, test, and evaluate regression models.
- Use **visualizations** to better explain relationships in the dataset.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## Dataset
- **Dataset:** California Housing (available in `sklearn.datasets`)
- **Features:** Median Income, Average Rooms, Population, House Age, etc.
- **Target:** Median house value in California districts.

## Steps Performed
1. **Load Dataset** using `fetch_california_housing`.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Dataset shape and description  
   - Correlation heatmap (Seaborn)  
   - Scatter plots & pair plots for insights  
3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Train-test split  
   - Feature scaling (if required)  
4. **Model Building:**
   - Linear Regression (single feature)  
   - Multiple Linear Regression (all features)  
5. **Evaluation:**
   - R² Score  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Visualize predictions vs actual values  

---

## Results
- **Linear Regression (1 feature):** Basic understanding of regression.  
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** More accurate, realistic predictions.  
- Visualizations (scatter, regression line, 3D surface, heatmap) provided clear insights.  
- **R² Score:** ~ (fill after running model).
